Approaching my mid-twenties, it dawned on me how undirected most people - they flutter from job-to-job, blown by the twin winds of circumstance and specialisation. I noticed this in my own thinking - how incidental my occupational decisions are.

Having experienced academia, startups, corporates and freelancing...

## A model of fulfilment

I am a statistician. That gives me the right to take the inherent, causal complexity of the world and reduce it to background noise. Watch me wave my wand.

Let's assume we have an agent-based, statistical model. The human is the agent - a decision-maker with a history of interactions, a future with choices to make and rewards associated with these choices. This agent has an internal value function that anticipates (predicts) the reward associated with different choices and seeks to maximise the total reward.

By a history of interactions, I mean an experience of certain types of work and the level of fulfilment they induced.

So with this simple model we can begin to understand why finding fulfilling work is hard.

**1. The objective is ill-defined**

Fulfilment is a fuzzy, multi-variate, highly personalised metric. Many things go into determining your level of fulfilment - the amount of money you earn, the legacy of your upbringing, the perceived status of the job, the ability to make a difference, the ability to travel, your desire to learn new things versus exercise talent etc.

**2. The historical data is biased and incomplete**

Our work history is the product of a chaotic process. Small changes to the initial conditions, a different school or friends group perhaps, would have led to us spiralling on some radically different journey. Couple this sensitivity to initial conditions with the [chain reaction of behaviour and subsequent self-justification](https://www.capitalideasonline.com/wordpress/the-pyramid-of-choice/) - now our historical data has sample bias.

**3. Our internal value function adapts and changes over time**



4. Our historical data is lossy





1. We have  incomplete historical information - our journey to the present contains bias.
2. "Fulfillment" is a fuzzy, multi-variate concept.
3. The outcome is a fuzzy one - there is significant noise.



Whats missing?

\- Multi-agent environment 



Our decision-making process is skewed by 

The task of finding fulfilling work is a decision-making system - it has inputs, a function/models and outputs.

Bad decision-making 



Good decision-making





My heuristics for choosing fulfilling work:

1. Am I building something that people want?
2. Am I collaborating with people I admire?
3. Am I working on problems with meaning consequences?



Notes:

* Over the course of a 40 year full-time career, around 10,000 days will be devoted to "work". That's 70% of every year.
* sequential decision making process with partially observable state (POMDP)



**Finding Fulfilling Work as POMDP** 

Most people would agree that the task of finding fulfilling work is a hard one.

We can frame the problem in terms of statistical modelling - data, model, code.

We use historical data as the basis for our predictions

We can formulate the task of finding fulfilling work as a sequential decision making process.

Imagine a human as an agent. An agent has a value function - a fancy term for a probabilistic estimation of the utility that comes with each choice ("work" in this example). It is probabilistic because 

Each agent starts on their journey without being able to observe the 

has a history of encounters with different types of "work". The decisions to informed by their upbringing, schooling

We use historical data to estimate the expected fulfilment of different work alternatives.
